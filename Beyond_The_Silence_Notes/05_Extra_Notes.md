# Extra Notes & Best Practices

- Use `set_deferred()` when disabling collisions or physics to avoid crashes.
- Prefer `lerp()` for smooth transitions (camera, UI, animations).
- Organize InputMap early to avoid conflicts later.
- Keep Nuxly modular: one script for follow, one for loot, one for combat.
- Save frequently and push to GitHub (you dodged a bullet already 🔫).
